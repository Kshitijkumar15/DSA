## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. Understanding them is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to provide implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms to help you learn and apply these concepts.

## Data Structures

Here, you can find implementations of common data structures like:
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure folder includes implementation details, sample code, and explanations.

## Algorithms

We also provide implementations of algorithms such as:
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

Each algorithm folder contains code and explanations to help you understand how they work and when to use them.
